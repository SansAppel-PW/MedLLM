The patient stays on the inpatient psychiatric unit and lab values are drawn and return as follows:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 135 mEq/L\nK+: 3.0 mEq/L\nCl-: 92 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 22 mEq/L\nBUN: 7 mg/dL\nCa2+: 8.4 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 0.6 mg/dL\nGlucose: 70 mg/dL\n\nThat patient is started on an intravenous solution containing potassium chloride and is closely monitored. His oral intake also seems to be improving. Lab values are ordered again the following day and return as follows:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 137 mEq/L\nK+: 2.9 mEq/L\nCl-: 95 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 22 mEq/L\nBUN: 8 mg/dL\nCa2+: 9.0 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.0 mg/dL\nGlucose: 77 mg/dL\n\nThe patient is continued on IV fluids and his clinical symptoms seem to further improve. Repeat labs the following three days remains largely unchanged. The patient's symptoms improve and he is determined to be at his baseline in terms of functioning.
