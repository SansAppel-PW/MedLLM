He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity.
