Further investigation reveals that most people in the area work in a glass factory, the region’s main source of employment. A researcher is interested in studying the role of immunosurveillance in the pathogenesis of this lung cancer. He postulates that tumor infiltration by natural killer (NK) cells has a better prognosis since they play a major role in immunosurveillance. NK cells also kill tumor cells by the perforin-mediated destruction of cancerous cells. The researcher is interested in studying tumor infiltration by NK cells in the resected specimen from patients within the cohort who have been diagnosed with stage 1 lung cancer.

Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.\nResults: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method.
